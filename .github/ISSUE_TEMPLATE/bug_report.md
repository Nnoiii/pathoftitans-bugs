## Expected Behavior
Delivery being available the moment the hint pops up. / The Quest tracker localization being in GER
## Current Behavior
Currently only the Anodonto has the Issue that it is not able to deliver as per hint-popup. It needs to almost stand on the Delivery-counter to make the delivery work.
/ The Quest TrackerÂ´s second row (shown as marked) shows the Text in ENG even though everything else is in GER.
## Reproduction Steps

- Get a Delivery-Quest as Anodonto

- Bring the item to the designated area

- Struggle to find the right spot for a moment to actually deliver it
